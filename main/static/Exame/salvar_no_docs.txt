I cant point to an exact moment when I learned this lesson, it was more of a maturing thing. The lesson I lerned and continue to learn is to put things in perspective. When I was little I used to  suffer a lot over little things. When I got older I remeber seeing my little cousing crying for something really smal and realised how I used to do the same, i talked to her that its not worth it. I always found my self to look a like this cousing and it giving adivace to her is always rewarding, she is very smart but is commiting the same "errors" than my self from the past. Puting things in perspective really changed the way I looked at everything. Bad thing happen but its not the end of the world. even things that are considered huge by "mature" people as college I don't think is that huge in a bigger scheme of things, I am healpghy, my family is alive and well, once you realise and appreciate that other tings seen very little.
